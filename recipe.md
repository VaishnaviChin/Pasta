First, take your pasta and add it to a pot of salted boiling water. Wait for the pasta to soften or to your desired hardness. 
The pasta will take some time to cook so if you want to be a little healthy while the pasta is cooking you can make your veggies, 
After the pasta is boiled, drain the water and put the pasta in a skillet. Use medium-low heat. The reason we don't use the High Heat setting is because we dont want our pasta,seasonings,and sauce to burn.
After you combine your sauce and seasonings add your desired amount of cheese, I use about 1/4 of a cup of cheese for 2 servings! 
Wait for it to cool a little and then serve with fresh basil garnish!
